Description: Gibbs sampler for Bayesian linear regression with the horseshoe
    prior (Carvalho, Polson & Scott, 2010), supporting selective
    per-parameter penalization control. Implements the auxiliary-variable
    sampler from Makalic & Schmidt (2015, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1508.03884>) with extensions
    for unpenalized coefficient subsets (flat priors on user-specified
    parameters), convergence diagnostics via effective sample size (ESS),
    posterior credible intervals, CATE extraction for multi-arm treatment
    designs, and full S3 method support (print, summary, predict, coef,
    vcov, confint). Depends only on base R packages.
